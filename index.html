          Street fashion has a long history and has evolved significantly over
          the years. In the 1950s and 1960s, street fashion was heavily
          influenced by subcultures such as the Mods and the Rockers, who were
          known for their distinctive fashion styles. In the 1970s and 1980s,
          punk and hip hop culture had a major influence on street fashion, and
          in the 1990s, grunge and skate culture were also influential.

          Today, street fashion is a diverse and constantly evolving phenomenon
          that encompasses a wide range of styles and trends. Some of the most
          popular street fashion styles include streetwear, which is
          characterized by casual, comfortable clothing such as sneakers,
          hoodies, and jeans; and urban fashion, which is inspired by urban
          culture and includes styles such as baggy jeans and oversized jackets.
